## [1.8.0] - 2026-04-13

### Security
- **JWT Secret Hardening** — Removed the hardcoded fallback secret. Server now refuses to start if `JWT_SECRET` environment variable is not set, preventing token forgery with the known default key.
- **Password Reset Tokens** — Replaced JWT-based password reset tokens (derived from the user's password hash) with cryptographically random 32-byte tokens stored in a new `password_reset_tokens` DB table with a 1-hour expiry. Tokens are single-use and deleted on successful reset.
- **Password Complexity** — Raised minimum password length from 6 to 8 characters and now require at least one letter and one number on both registration and password reset.
- **XSS — BBCode CSS Injection** — `[color]` and `[size]` BBCode tags now validate their values against a strict whitelist (hex or named color; numeric 1–100) before injecting into style attributes. Arbitrary CSS expressions are rejected.
- **XSS — Forum Media Rendering** — YouTube embeds now extract only the 11-character video ID via regex before inserting into iframe src, rejecting `javascript:` and other malicious schemes. Video and image src values are validated to begin with `https://`. All media gallery items replaced inline `onclick` strings with `data-*` attributes and a delegated event listener.
- **XSS — Feed YouTube Embeds** — Same YouTube video ID extraction applied to the social feed media renderer.
- **Security Headers** — Added `helmet` middleware with a Content Security Policy, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and other OWASP-recommended headers.
- **Rate Limiting** — Added `express-rate-limit` with strict limits on `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`, and `/api/auth/forgot-password` (20 req / 15 min) and a general API limit (300 req / min).
- **CORS** — Restricted CORS origin from wildcard `*` to the configured `siteUrl`. Socket.io inherits the same policy.
- **Pagination Limits** — Notifications and messages endpoints now clamp the `limit` query parameter to a maximum of 100, preventing memory exhaustion via `?limit=999999`.
- **Post Content Length** — Feed posts are capped at 10,000 characters server-side.
- **Socket.io DM Validation** — `send_message` events now verify the receiver exists in the database and that message content does not exceed 4,000 characters before persisting.
- **Error Message Sanitization** — Setup and admin routes no longer return raw `err.message` in API responses. Errors are logged server-side and generic messages are returned to the client.
- **Admin Audit Log** — Destructive admin actions (ban, unban, delete user, role change) are now recorded in a new `admin_audit_log` table with actor, target, and timestamp.
- **Parameterized Forgot-Password Query** — Replaced a full `SELECT * FROM users` + JS `.find()` with a single parameterized `WHERE LOWER(email) = LOWER(?)` query.
- **npm Audit** — Patched all 9 known vulnerabilities (4 moderate, 5 high) in `brace-expansion`, `lodash`, `nodemailer`, `path-to-regexp`, `picomatch`, `socket.io-parser`, and `undici` via `npm audit fix`.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Centralized Logger (`server/logger.js`)** — Replaced all `console.error/warn/log` calls across the entire server codebase with a structured Winston-based logger. Outputs to:
  - Console (colorized in dev, JSON in prod)
  - `logs/combined-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — all levels, 14-day rotation
  - `logs/error-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — errors only, 30-day retention
  - `logs/security-YYYY-MM-DD.log` — auth and admin audit events, 90-day retention
- **Security Event Logging** — Authentication events now emit structured security log entries: `login_success`, `login_failed` (with reason: user_not_found / wrong_password), `login_blocked_banned`, `password_reset_requested`, `password_reset_invalid_token`, `password_reset_success`.
- **IP Logging on Auth Events** — Client IP address is captured and included in all security log entries for login and password reset flows.
- **Log File Rotation** — `winston-daily-rotate-file` provides daily rotation with gzip archiving and automatic cleanup by retention period.

### Changed
- `logs/` directory added to `.gitignore` — log files are never committed.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed
- **Session Handling — Sudden Logouts** — JWT tokens were issued with a 2-hour expiry and there was no refresh mechanism, causing admin and long-lived sessions to silently expire. Tokens are now issued with a 7-day expiry.
- **Token Refresh on 401** — `api.js` now catches a 401 response, attempts a silent token refresh via `POST /api/auth/refresh`, and retries the original request once before forcing a logout. Transient auth failures no longer immediately terminate the session.
- **Socket Reconnect After Token Expiry** — `socket-client.js` now detects `Invalid token` / `Authentication required` connect errors, refreshes the token, updates `socket.auth.token`, and reconnects automatically instead of silently failing.
- **Maintenance Mode Role Check** — The client-side maintenance bypass check now correctly allows `superadmin` and `moderator` roles through, consistent with server-side `requireAdmin` middleware. Previously only `admin` was permitted.

### Added
- **`POST /api/auth/refresh`** — New endpoint that accepts a valid JWT and re-issues a fresh 7-day token. Returns `403` for banned accounts. Multiple simultaneous refresh calls coalesce into a single request.
- **Auto-Refresh** — On login, the client starts a 30-minute periodic refresh timer and additionally refreshes whenever the browser tab regains focus, keeping long-lived sessions alive proactively.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Ban Appeal System** — Complete ban appeal application allowing banned users to submit appeals and track their status with a visual progress tracker (Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Declined).
  - Banned users can log in with restricted access (appeal page + settings only)
  - Visual status tracker similar to Walmart order tracking with animated progress dots
  - 7-day cooldown period between declined appeals
  - Full admin dashboard for managing appeals with approve/decline workflow
  - Appeal history tracking and audit logging
  - Responsive design with mobile support
- **Messenger — UI & Mobile Polish** — Full structural and visual rebuild of the messenger UI to achieve Discord/Fluxer-parity. The Friends list has been integrated directly into the main message view via a "Friends" button in the sidebar. Fully implemented mobile responsive design featuring a slide-in sidebar (toggleable via hamburger menu), adjusted touch targets (44px minimum), safe-area insets for notches/keyboards, and long-press touch support for context menus. Fixed markdown underline rendering.

### Fixed
- **Messenger Message Indentation & Grouping** — Fixed an issue where text messages were being pushed to the right by eliminating hidden template whitespace in the message content container. Also updated the message grouping logic so that messages sent by the same user within 5 minutes are grouped together without vertical spacing, identical to Discord.
- **Messenger Layout & Replies** — Fixed massive internal message padding by applying correct flex alignment. Aligned the layout to a cohesive block, ensuring correct text flow and timestamp placement. Timestamps are now visible on hover for follow-up messages. Restructured replies to show above the message header and implemented an interactive snippet with an anchor-link ("jump to") feature that temporarily highlights the original message.
- **Messenger Navigation & Sync** — Fixed an issue where new channels and spaces required a page refresh to display by automatically subscribing the socket to new spaces upon creation/joining and instantly rendering locally created channels.
- **Messenger URLs** — The URL hash now actively updates to reflect the current space, channel, or DM, allowing users to safely refresh the page and return to their active chat instead of the default welcome screen.
- **Messenger/Admin Performance** — Fixed an issue where the main website UI flashed before loading fullscreen apps like the Messenger or Admin Dashboard. The UI elements now immediately hide to prevent the flash. Heavy background processes (like the `ParticleEngine` and `WebGLEngine` loops) are now instantly paused when overlaying fullscreen apps to heavily optimize browser resource usage.
- **Messenger — Settings System** — Full Discord-style per-user settings modal accessible from the gear button in the messenger sidebar footer. Organised into four tabs:
  - *Privacy & Safety*: Who can DM you (Everyone / Friends Only / Nobody), Message Requests toggle, Auto-Accept Requests, Show Online Status, Show Read Receipts, Allow Friend Requests via DM.
  - *Notifications*: DM notification level (All / Mentions / Nothing), Notification Sounds, Message Preview in Notifications.
  - *Text & Appearance*: Compact Mode, Emoji Size (Small / Medium / Large), Link Previews.
  - *Advanced*: Developer Mode (Copy ID context menu items), clear local DM cache.
- **Messenger — Message Requests** — Non-friend DM attempts now route through an approval queue when the recipient has message requests enabled. A badge on the settings button shows the pending count. Senders receive a "request sent" toast; recipients can accept or decline from the Message Requests inbox. Accepting opens the conversation immediately. Real-time socket events notify both parties on accept/decline.
- **Messenger — DM Policy Enforcement** — `POST /dm` now checks the target user's privacy settings before creating a channel: `allow_dms = 'nobody'` blocks all attempts; `allow_dms = 'friends'` rejects non-friends with a clear error message.
- **Messenger — Schema** — Added `messenger_settings` and `message_requests` tables with full indices.

### Fixed
- **Messenger — User Search** — User search in the New DM modal now correctly returns all non-banned users site-wide (not just friends). Minimum query length reduced to 1 character. Exact username/display-name matches are ranked first. Server error messages are surfaced in the UI instead of showing a generic "No users found."

- **Themes & UI** — Introduced extensive new personalization options for "Glassmorphism & Opacity" (Solid, Light Glass, Heavy Glass) and "Card Borders" (Hidden, Subtle, Neon Glow), allowing users to completely customize the aesthetic of panels, cards, and dropdowns.
- **Layouts & Navigation** — Initiated Phase 1 of the Enterprise Layouts overhaul. Added 2 brand new highly animated, enterprise-grade navigational layouts: "Cyber-Float" (a glassmorphic floating sidebar) and "Neon-Bar" (an animated, edge-to-edge top navigation bar).
- **Themes & UI** — Rebuilt all color schemes from scratch, replacing the old legacy names (bame, mykd, gamon, gio, etc.) with 11 brand new beautifully crafted, unique themes (Obsidian, Nebula, Synthwave, Toxic, Magma, Solarflare, Glacier, Bubblegum, Hologram, Stealth, Cyberpunk).
- **Themes & UI** — Built a new WebGL-powered Lava Lamp background using custom shaders.
- **Themes & UI** — Restored theme customization options (Settings icons) for dynamic backgrounds like Pink Bubbles and Lava Lamp in the Personalization modal.
- **Navigation** — Built a Minecraft creeper SVG and replaced the generic grid navigation icon for the Minecraft extension.
- **Themes & UI** â€” Integrated Three.js to support WebGL animated backgrounds. Added 7 new interactive 3D themes (Cyberpunk, Matrix, Stars, Geometry, Fluid, Aurora, Particles) to the Themes Store.
- **Themes & UI** — Decoupled Layout, Color Palette, and Backgrounds into independent options inside the new Appearance Settings modal. Users can now freely mix-and-match CSS colors with any 2D canvas or 3D WebGL background engine.
- **Themes & UI** — Added two new responsive layout options: "Compact" and "Wide".
- **Themes & UI** — Added a brand new **Top Navbar** layout option. Navigation items are displayed in a simple horizontal row (up to 5 visible at once). If total nav items exceed 5, a **"More"** trigger button appears, opening a polished slide-in side panel listing overflow items. Panel closes on backdrop click or any link navigation.
- **Navigation** — `OverflowNav` singleton added: manages the 5-item visibility window, populates the overflow drawer, and re-evaluates on layout switches and extension injection. Fully replaces the problematic `NavCarousel` scroll engine.

### Fixed
- **Navigation** — Fixed the user section (avatar + action buttons) in the Sidebar layout not sticking to the bottom of the nav. Changed `.nav-user` `margin-top` from a fixed spacing value to `auto`, which correctly pushes it to the bottom of the sidebar flex column.
- **Themes & UI** — All `this.theme` references in `ParticleEngine` that controlled background *behavior* (not color) have been corrected to use `this.bgStyle`, fully decoupling color from geometry.
- **Themes & UI** — `WebGLEngine.clearScene()` now null-guards `this.scene` to prevent crash if engine was never initialized before a theme switch.
- **Themes & UI** — `WebGLEngine.getCssColor()` now catches exceptions and strips `rgba()` alpha channels before passing to `THREE.Color` to prevent parse errors.
- **Themes & UI** — Division-by-zero guards added to particle mouse repulsion and camera ray projection calculations.
- **Themes & UI** — `App.init()` now restores all three saved appearance settings (layout, color, background) on every page load, preventing resets on refresh.
- **Navigation** â€” Fixed an issue where the profile picture dropdown menu was transparent by restoring the missing `.notifications-dropdown` CSS selector.
- **Donations Extension** â€” Fixed an issue in the public donations history list where users without an avatar or Minecraft username were loading a broken image link. Now gracefully falls back to a dynamically generated initial/letter avatar.

### Changed
- **Admin Dashboard** â€” Full redesign of the Extensions management dashboard, replacing the basic list with a modern glassmorphic grid layout, active count stats, and enhanced visual hierarchy.
- **Donations Extension** â€” Redesigned the "Overview" and "Ranks" tabs in the admin panel with modern glassmorphic cards and improved visual hierarchy.

### Improved
- **Admin Dashboard** â€” Added a "Back to Site" button in the sidebar footer for easier navigation back to the feed.
